        <span>Hi, I’m Max. Nice to meet you.</span> I am a designer and
        developer with a wide range of experience in various digital and
        artistic disciplines.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am passionate about making beautiful and functional products that
        improve the lives of those around me. I have skills and experience in
        web development, 3D design, low-level systems, and various other kinds
        of software development. I’m also an athlete, photographer,
        advisor, leader, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t like to define myself by the skills I have or the technologies I
        know. Skills and technologies are easy to teach. I define myself by my
        experience, problem-solving, and creativity.
      </p>

        pursuit of study, hobbies, sport, and artistic endeavours.
